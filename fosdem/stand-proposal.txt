Project Name: Jenkins

Stand description:

Historically the Jenkins stand is manned by about 3-8 community members
throughout the weekend who use the opportunity to meet with users who already
knew about us (and give them stickers!), talk about how the project works/where
it's going, and demonstrate Jenkins to people who never knew about it.

We would very likely be doing much more of the same this time around if
accepted, demonstrating Jenkins to new-comers as well as meeting
users/developers who are interested in meeting some of the faces "behind the
project."

Why should FOSDEM accept this proposal?:

Besides the usefulness of Jenkins, the two best parts about the project are the
underlying transparency/openness and pragmatism. FOSDEM has become an annual
tradition for the Jenkins developers in Europe, giving us the chance to
interact with hundreds (if not thousands) of friendly users with positive and
negative feedback. Because we've got so many european contributors, the Jenkins
stand is almost always multilingual with conversations about the project in
english, french, german and dutch happening with interested people.


Overall the experience, and the vibe is fantastic at FOSDEM and I think the
Jenkins group brings a friendliness and enthusiasm for open source (and
automation) that helps make FOSDEM a stellar event.


We look forward to participating in FOSDEM 2015 one way or the other!
