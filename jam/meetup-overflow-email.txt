Hello! I'm sending you this email because you have RSVPed to the [CITY] Jenkins Area Meetup
we're hosting at [VENUE] ([URL]). We have a limited amount of space and there are people
on the wait-list already!

If you're not able to make it, please update your RSVP status so we
can allow those on the wait-list to attend.

For those that will be able to attend, I hope you're as excited as I am to
hear about [TOPICS],

Looking forward to seeing you there!
